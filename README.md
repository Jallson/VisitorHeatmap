# VisitorHeatmap
This object detection project leverages Edge Impulse's FOMO to track the coordinates and time spent by objects (visitors) at specific locations, visualizing this data as a dynamic heat map overlaid on live video. The model will be deployed on an Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, ensuring efficient real-time performance.
